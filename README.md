Hello, I'm Typhaine ! ✨

Currently a student at the University of Caen (France), I'm studying Computer Science related to health.
I have a bachelor's degree and I'm in my last year of a master's degree.

As well as computers, I really like photography, video games, and many things related to design, as web design, drawing, etc ...
